## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

  I learned more on the float and clear property as well as web page grid views and @media queries for mobile,tablet and desktop designs which helped me to make the web page responsive
  It was interesting to know about the twelve grid views each constituting of a width of 
  (100/12)% =8.33%.
  i was also able to assign a background image based on the device width.
  It was difficult inducing flexbox for the responsiveness and using the float property was a more suitable alternative. 



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
[class*="col-"] {
  float:left;
  width:100%;
}
.main::after{
  clear: both;
  content: "";
  display:table:

}

```


### Continued development
I intend to work next on making a responsive navbar.

### Useful resources
